# Description

The data visualization (see image below) of this module is based on the following
Pew Research Center post/article by Katherine Schaeffer (Oct 10, 2023):

__Most U.S. presidents have been in their 50s at inauguration__

<https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/10/most-us-presidents-have-been-in-their-50s-at-inauguration/>

## R Packages

# Data

The data for ages of US presidents is available in Wikipedia:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age>

Specifically, the data is in the HTML table  "Presidential age-related data"
of the Wikipedia webpage.


## Download Data

For data archival purposes, it's a good idea to download the HTML page 
containing the table with the data of interest: "Presidential age-related data"

```{r eval = FALSE}
wiki = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
presidents = "List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age"

wiki_url = paste0(wiki, presidents)

download.file(wiki_url, destfile = paste0(presidents, ".html"))
```


## Import Data

You can import the data directly from the Wikipedia webpage (via its URL), or 
by reading-in the downloaded HTML file. In both cases we can read-in the HTML 
page with the function `read_html()` from the package `"rvest"`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# import directly from wikipedia
wiki = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
presidents = "List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age"

wiki_url = paste0(wiki, presidents)

doc = read_html(wiki_url)
```

Because we have a local copy of the HTML page, we prefer this option:

```{r}
# import from downloaded HTML file
doc = read_html("List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age.html")
```

The function `read_html()` extracts ALL tables in an HTML document, and returns
them in an R list. 

The table we are interested in---**Presidential age-related data**---is the 
first one in the list which we can select with the following command:

```{r}
tbls = html_table(doc)

tbl = tbls[[1]]

# get rid of first row
tbl = tbl[-1, ]
tbl
```


## Data Preparation

Here's the list of (somewhat advanced) steps to do further manipulation so that 
we have the necessary data for `ggplot`.

```{r}
# age at start of presidential period
age_start = as.numeric(str_extract(tbl$`Age atstart of presidency`, "^\\d+"))

# age at the end of presidential period
age_end = as.numeric(str_extract(tbl$`Age atend of presidency`, "^\\d+"))

# Donald Trump's current age
age_end[47] = 78

year_start = as.numeric(str_extract(tbl$`Age atstart of presidency`, "\\d+$"))

year_end = as.numeric(str_extract(tbl$`Age atend of presidency`, "\\d{4}"))
year_end[47] = 2025
```


### Adding Party

```{r}
party = c(
  "Other",      # "Washington"
  "Federalist", # "Adams"     
  "Federalist", # "Jefferson" 
  "Federalist", # "Madison"   
  "Federalist", # "Monroe"    
  "Federalist", # "Adams"     
  "Democratic", # "Jackson"   
  "Democratic", # "Buren"     
  "Whig",       # "Harrison"  
  "Whig",       # "Tyler"     
  "Democratic", # "Polk"      
  "Whig",       # "Taylor"    
  "Whig",       # "Fillmore"  
  "Democratic", # "Pierce"    
  "Democratic", # "Buchanan"  
  "Republican", # "Lincoln"   
  "Democratic", # "Johnson"   
  "Republican", # "Grant"     
  "Republican", # "Hayes"     
  "Republican", # "Garfield"  
  "Republican", # "Arthur"    
  "Democratic", # "Cleveland" 
  "Republican", # "Harrison"  
  "Democratic", # "Cleveland" 
  "Republican", # "McKinley"  
  "Republican", # "Roosevelt" 
  "Republican", # "Taft"      
  "Democratic", # "Wilson"    
  "Republican", # "Harding"   
  "Republican", # "Coolidge"  
  "Republican", # "Hoover"    
  "Democratic", # "Roosevelt" 
  "Democratic", # "Truman"    
  "Republican", # "Eisenhower"
  "Democratic", # "Kennedy"   
  "Democratic", # "Johnson"   
  "Republican", # "Nixon"     
  "Republican", # "Ford"      
  "Democratic", # "Carter"    
  "Republican", # "Reagan"    
  "Republican", # "Bush"      
  "Democratic", # "Clinton"   
  "Republican", # "Bush"      
  "Democratic", # "Obama"     
  "Republican", # "Trump"     
  "Democratic", # "Biden"
  "Republican"  # Trump
)
```


### Clean Table

Having all the ingredients in place we proceed to assemble a "tidy" table
(this can be a `"tibble"` or also a `"data.frame"`)

```{r}
dat = tibble(
  "president" = tbl$President, 
  "party" = party,
  "age_start" = age_start, 
  "age_end" = age_end,
  "year_start" = year_start,
  "year_end" = year_end)

dat = dat |>
  mutate(color = case_when(
    party == "Democratic" ~ "#468BFA",
    party == "Republican" ~ "#FC4E4B",
    .default = "#FFD438"
  ))

dat
```

# Graphs

As usual, let's go over a series of plotting rounds, starting with a default
bar chart, and then gradually adding more elements, and customizing its appearance to get as close as possible to our target visualization.


## Version 1

We use 2 `geom_point()` layers since there are 2 kinds of points: the 
starting age-year, and the ending age-year.

```{r}
# 1st attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end))
```



## Version 2

Adding color to points

```{r}
# 2nd attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color)
```


## Version 3

Adding median age line

```{r}
# 3rd attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color) 
```



## Version 4

```{r}
# 4th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
```



## Version 5

```{r}
# 5th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start, xend = year_end, yend = age_end)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
```



## Version 6

```{r}
# 6th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start, xend = year_end, yend = age_end),
               linewidth = 1.5, color = dat$color, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
```


## Version 7

```{r}
# 7th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start, xend = year_end, yend = age_end),
               linewidth = 1.5, color = dat$color, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start,
                label = str_extract(president, "\\w+$")), size = 2.5, color = dat$color) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
```


## Version 8

```{r}
# 8th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), color = dat$color, shape = 21) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start, xend = year_end, yend = age_end),
               linewidth = 1.5, color = dat$color, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end, label = str_extract(president, "\\w+$")),
            size = 2.5, color = dat$color, vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
```



## Final attempt

```{r}
# 9th attempt
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(30, 90, by = 10), 
             linetype = "dotted", color = "gray70") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(dat$age_start), linewidth = 0.25) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start, xend = year_end, yend = age_end),
               linewidth = 1.5, color = dat$color, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_start, y = age_start), 
             color = dat$color, shape = 21, fill = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end), 
             color = dat$color, shape = 21, fill = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(x = year_end, y = age_end, label = str_extract(president, "\\w+$")),
            size = 2.5, color = dat$color, vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 90, by = 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1780, 2024, by = 12)) +
  labs(title = "Ages of U.S. presidents, 1789-2025",
       subtitle = "The median age at first inauguration is 55 years old",
       x = "",
       y = "age") +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
